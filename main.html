  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  
  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. A good algorithm has low time complexity and is considered more efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute completely. For example, an algorithm might use O(n) memory depending on the size of the input data. Optimizing <b>Space Complexity</b> helps balance performance and resource usage.
